## What is Glide?

Glide is a tool for managing the `vendor` directory within a Go package. This feature, first introduced in Go 1.5, allows each package to have a `vendor` directory containing dependent packages for the project. These vendor packages can be installed by a tool (e.g. `glide`), similar to `go get` or they can be vendored and distributed with the package.

Are you used to tools such as Cargo, npm, Composer, Nuget, Pip, Maven, Bundler, or other modern package managers? If so, Glide is the comparable Go tool.
